# PWA To-Do Application

## Overview

This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built as a To-Do application. The app allows users to add, view, and remove tasks. The tasks are stored locally using either IndexedDB or localStorage to persist data even when the app is offline. The app also features a responsive user interface and demonstrates core PWA concepts such as service workers, offline functionality, and client-side data storage.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Add, view, and remove tasks.
- **Offline Capability:** Functionality available offline using service workers and IndexedDB/localStorage.
- **Responsive UI:** The app is mobile-friendly and adjusts well to different screen sizes.
- **Task Prioritization:** Assign priority levels to tasks (e.g., urgent, normal, low).
- **Data Storage:** Uses IndexedDB/localStorage to store tasks locally.
- **Service Worker:** Caches resources to enable offline use.
